COLLEGE PROJECT

This project was done in college.
It is a WordPress blog that covers blockchain technology, current news about cryptocurrencies, and my personal perspective on the future of blockchain technology/cryptocurrencies.
Here, I learned how to create a WordPress site and publish it online. I chose blockchain as a theme because I am personally interested in it.
